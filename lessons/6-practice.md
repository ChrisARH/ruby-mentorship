# Lesson 6 - Practice

Let's build a shopping list program together! :)

## Gathering input

In this part we'll focus on getting the input from the user to compile a shopping list.

The program should be interactive and allow the user to quit when the list is deemed complete.

[`example`](/lessons/examples/lesson-6-gathering-input.rb)

## Showing input

Make sure to give the user opportunities along the way to see which items are on the list at the moment.

[`example`](/lessons/examples/lesson-6-showing-input.rb)

## Quantification

Allow the user to specify how many/much of each item should be on the shopping list.

[`example`](/lessons/examples/lesson-6-quantities.rb)

# Homework

Try to extend one of the programs you wrote in the past with a new feature - anything goes! :)

Bonus 1:
Swap programs with somebody else and try to expand on a program you didn't write yourself.
Alternatively feel free to use any of the code in this repository as a starting point.
